Project Description
-------------------

The final project will put to work a majority of the concepts and tools you have learned in the class. The project can be individual or in teams of two people.

The final project involves:

1.  Design of a circuit using the theory tools from the first part of class
2.  Capture of the schematic of the circuit
3.  Layout of a 2-layer PCB for the circuit
4.  Assembly of the PCB
5.  Testing
6.  Documenting the operation of the circuit and your experiences

The electronic circuit must feature as a minimum:

*   Digital control devices (digital logic gates, microcontrollers, FPGA's, etc)
*   At least one analog circuit for input or output (op-amps, transistors, filters)
*   Power regulation. The power input can be selected from:
    *   Batteries (preferred)
    *   An AC transformer - you cannot work on the 120Vac part, only the low voltage part
    *   An unregulated DC transformer and/or power supply

The design must be simple and adhere to the following limits:

*   A maximum of 30 parts/components (excluding bypass capacitors and pull-up/down resistors)
*   No components of more than 30 pins
*   No "ball grid array" (BGA) components
*   A maximum of 3 operating voltages

While there is no obvious/deterministic method to figure out exactly how complex the board will be, note that all project PCB's will be limited to:

*   2 layers (top and bottom)
*   Round holes
*   "Normal" shapes

Deliverables
------------

The following must be delivered for the project:

1.  Schematic
    *   Schematic - a full schematic of the project
    *   Bill of materials - the list of all components, including package and ordering information
2.  Layout
    *   Layout file - the CAD file with the circuit board layout
    *   Layout plots - 1:1 printouts of individual layers and combined board
    *   Manufacturing files - the files which will be used to manufacture the PCB
3.  Documentation
    *   Circuit documentation - a document which is effectively a "data sheet" for your circuit (more details on documentation will be provided later)
    *   Experience documentation - a document which describes your experience in designing, building, and testing the circuit
4.  Circuit
    *   If your layout files are ready in time for manufacturing, you will turn in your actual PCB (which you can keep later) for evaluation (assembly and operation); otherwise you will turn in another previously designed circuit

Example Projects
----------------

*   Motion Control
    *   Closed loop control of multiple motors
        *   For multi-DOF robot arms
        *   To drive 4+ wheels
*   Sensing
    *   Force feedback sensor
    *   Electronic "wall"
*   Communications
    *   Digital wireless system integration

Proposal
--------

The proposal in Week #8 should include:

1.  A description of the project in words, stating what your system is going to do and how you plan to implement it
2.  A block diagram of the circuit design (black box design without full detail)
3.  A set of specifications that define in detail:
    *   Inputs and outputs (whether electrical or physical)
    *   What tests will be used to prove that it functions properly

The proposal should be typewritten.
